# NOTE: This script replaces the one from the baseimage. Wine has its own way
#       of installing and activating CJK font:
#         - Font file is pre-installed under the WINEPREFIX.
#         - Font is installed by applying settings in registry.
# NOTE: Setting the `LANG` environment variable is also enough to properly
#       display CJK characters.
